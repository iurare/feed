/></p><p>I’ve learned in recent years that cinemas are like churches. They can exist in any space as long as there are people who believe. At Karlovy Vary, a cinema exists in a grand hall, it exists in a large ballroom adorned by crystal light fixtures, it exists in a tiny room with simple, metal chairs—where one can order pickled cheese and bread from the concession stand—and it exists in the back of a sunny cafe whose outside displays posters of the newest films opening in Czech Republic, such as local rom-coms and “<a href=\"/reviews/minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review-2022\">Minions: The Rise of Gru</a>.”</p> <p>The believers are so passionate here, they sit on the theater’s steps on the wings hoping to catch a glimpse of the revelations that can so seamlessly reveal themselves on a movie screen. It’s enough to make any agnostic a fiend for film. </p> <p>Today I entered these flexible cathedrals to take in three movies: Two arrived from Cannes, and another from Berlinale. They speak, to varying degrees of success, to the oft forgotten people and the important tensions that mercilessly tear our worlds apart. They also shock and surprise for different levels of pleasure. </p> <p>For instance, whenever you think you know where Maryam Touzani’s entrancing drama “<strong>The Blue Caftan</strong>” is going, she blindsides you with a fierce emotional wallop. The Morrocan-set story of Halim (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/saleh-bakri\">Saleh Bakri</a>), a maalem (dressmaker), is a nuanced and empathetic tale about sexuality and mortality. He and his stern wife Mina (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/lubna-azabal\">Lubna Azabal</a>) are operating their caftan business at a loss: Partially because an at-first mysterious illness afflicts Mina, leading to debilitating hospital bills. They’ve recently hired an apprentice, Youssef (Ayoub Missioui) to help ease the burden. But his emergence brings home an unmistakable truth about Halim: He’s gay. </p> <p>Indeed, Halim often ventures to the baths to cruise for hook-ups. The space offers him some privacy and security away from a traditionalist society that pushes and pulls on him. For a maalem, it’s telling how his jacket is just a tad too big, making him look discomforted in his own clothes. Halim also springs from the past. The world doesn’t care for his craft anymore: They want immediate results—one impatient customer explains how you can barely tell the difference between machine and handmade caftans—or tighter fitting caftans, no matter the material. Halim takes immense pride in his craft, and one caftan in particular, a blue one, for a woman we never meet, demands the full breadth of his skills to complete. </p> <p>There are so few wasted sounds (the sounds of the seagulls) and shots, especially as the film unwinds, revealing unsuspecting layers to these characters. Mina, for instance, moves from severe taskmaster to a vibrant, playful lover, who finds her greatest buoyancy at her sickest. Youssef also evolves from muse and pupil, someone Hamil can give his creative passion to, into a fully formed person. Each actor discovers several corners of heartbreak, but it’s Touzani’s exacting craftsmanship, and her interest in her actors’ expressive eyes that tunnels toward a wellspring of spontaneous emotion. </p> <p>How Touzani ultimately utilizes the blue caftan for resonance is nothing short of brilliant, and the delicacy she imbues this story with is nothing short of potent. The stops she makes along the way, fully exploring these characters with grace, is assured. “The Blue Caftan” isn’t afraid to let romance be life-changing. </p> <figure><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62c45eedb8b50d37df7d26bf/content_triangle-of-sadness-kviff-2022.jpeg\" data-image=\"[object Object]\"></figure> <p>Cannes’ 2022 Palme d'Or winner, <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/ruben-stlund\">Ruben Östlund</a>’s eat-the-rich (with a sprinkle of their vapidness on the side) satire, “<strong>Triangle of Sadness</strong>,” is so tightly constructed that it’s a shame it’s so damn hollow. </p> <p>Split into three chapters by Östlund, the plot initially swims with strong currents: Carl (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/harris-dickinson\">Harris Dickinson</a>) and Yaya (Charlbi Dean) are models with money problems. A dinner date between the pair turns sour when they bicker over the check; Carl is back to open casting calls; Yaya uses her influencer platform to get free stuff. They’re both broke lifestyle whores papering over their canceled cards with promotional designer clothes. </p> <p>Through her influencing, in the film’s second chapter, Yaya gets her and Carl a free trip on a wealthy yacht populated by the super rich, such as arms dealers. One in particular, Dmitry (a wickedly funny <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/zlatko-buri\">Zlatko Burić</a>), a fertilizer salesman and self-proclaimed “King of Shit,” is a Russian capitalist through and through. <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/woody-harrelson\">Woody Harrelson</a> plays the ship’s perennially drunk captain, a Marxist rendered miserable by servicing the wealthy. </p> <p>The first half to “Triangle of Sadness” is a fast-paced, incisive statement against the wealthy that hilariously lampoons the callous capriciousness of the rich. It’s familiar territory for the director that never holds the blunt-force impact of his previous “The Square,” but is effective nonetheless (even if the major gag is a dinner scene, which stretches on for far too long, that devolves into vomiting and diarrhea). </p> <p>There’s no doubt about Östlund’s visual acumen—the camera movement and cinematography cover you in laughing gas—and yet, you’re never quite sure what more Östlund wants to say other than the rich are bad. Even in the third chapter, when some of them are stranded on a deserted island, he still casts his eye on Carl and Yaya even though they’re not interesting people. Maybe that’s the joke, but it doesn’t come with much of a punchline. The film’s most powerful character is Abigail (Dolly de Leon), a Filipina toilet manager who quickly harnesses power as the only competent survivalist among the group. The final shot in “Triangle of Sadness,” in fact, features Abigail holding a rock high above her head as she chooses between keeping this new society or returning back to servitude. It’s a powerful image delivered by a tremendous performance of de Leon in an all-too dim film. </p> <figure><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62c45f70306fcc71f362d1be/content_small-slow-but-steady-kviff-2022.jpeg\" data-image=\"[object Object]\"></figure> <p>Oftentimes your most anticipated film, in this case, “Triangle of Sadness,” can turn into your most disappointing. But a movie you don't expect can knock you to your knees. The latter happened with Japanese director Sho Miyake’s ruminative and aching boxing film “<strong>Small, Slow But Steady</strong>.” </p> <p>Miyake uses the pandemic to his narrative advantage to break every rule in the sports movie genre for a true story about a deaf woman boxer, Keiko Ogasawara (Yukino Kishii), who has lost her will to fight. Keiko spends her days in the ratty local gym owned by a veteran trainer, Mr. Sasaki (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/tomokazu-miura\">Tomokazu Miura</a>), whose eyesight and health are failing him. The gym is also facing closure due to the financial pressures of the pandemic. No one, not Keiko’s committed brother Seiji (Himi Sato) or her worried mom (Hiroko Nakajima) can bring back her desire to compete. Instead, it requires a personal search by the intensely quiet Keiko, helped by the silent bond shared between herself and Mr. Sasaki, to pull her forward. Miura and Kishii are wonderful together. Their father-daughter dynamic adds an external heartwarming mood in a movie where the greatest drama often occurs internally. </p> <p>As unhurried as any film (the title aptly describes its tone), this sports movie doesn’t feature any raucous crowds at ringside cheering on Keiko. There are no big speeches or major wins or a championship at the end. Keiko fights a relatively insignificant match at the end, in fact. But that’s a draw not a deterrent with this transfixing and profound narrative. \"Small, Slow, But Steady\" is a movie about life, and how sports can teach us how to persevere. The biggest win in the elegantly crafted film—best exemplified in a stirring final shot that’ll make you believe in the promise of the next day—is simply taking the next step toward the next fight, toward the next hill to climb, toward the next trouble that comes your way. </p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals/kviff-2022-the-blue-caftan-triangle-of-sadness-small-slow-but-steady\">https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals/kviff-2022-the-blue-caftan-triangle-of-sadness-small-slow-but-steady</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-05T12:37:49.000Z"},{"id":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review-2022","url":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review-2022","title":"Minions: The Rise of Gru","content_html":"<blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com\">All Content</a> <strong>Minions: The Rise of Gru</strong></p> <p>by Odie Henderson </p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review-2022/thumb_minions-the-rise-of-gru-movie-review-2022.jpeg\" /></p><p>“Minions: The Rise of Gru” takes place in 1976. Had I seen it that year, I would have laughed my six-year-old self silly and demanded to see it again and again. Alas, I’m not six years old anymore. My sense of humor, on the other hand, still hovers around that age. As a result, this latest (and hopefully last) chapter in the Despicable Me Universe (DMU) felt tailor-made for the less mature aspects of my sensibilities. It was as if a checklist had been made to cater to me. Afros and ‘70’s era fashions? Check! Badass women in action? Check! Awful puns and wordplay? You got it! Disco music? I can dig it! Potentially blasphemous, violent nun jokes? Oh baby!</p> <p>Readers of this site know of my soft spot for the Minions, those yellow, pill-shaped purveyors of trouble who are hopelessly devoted to Gru (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/steve-carell\">Steve Carell</a>). They make me laugh and I’m not even remotely remorseful about that. After their own prequel, “<a href=\"/reviews/minions-2015\">Minions</a>,” and a pit stop for the lackluster present-day sibling rivalry plot of “<a href=\"/reviews/despicable-me-3-2017\">Despicable Me 3</a>,” Kevin Le Minion and his one and two-eyed pals have returned to the past to support the “eleven and three-quarters” years old version of Gru. They affectionately call him \"mini-boss.\" When he’s not wondering how his employees “got so much denim” for their outfits, Gru is fantasizing about joining The Vicious 6, an Avengers-like conglomerate of villains created by Wild Knuckles (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/alan-arkin\">Alan Arkin</a>).</p> <p>We see Wild Knuckles and his crew in action in an exotic, Indiana Jones-style locale. They are there to retrieve a necklace of gems called The Zodiac Stones. Once retrieved, it will give the Vicious 6 an unlimited amount of power on the night of the Chinese New Year. Considering all the groan-inducing needle drops that occur in this series, I expected The Zodiac Stones to be accompanied by that trash classic-slash-astrology lesson “Float On” by the Floaters. Unfortunately, the filmmakers are not that clever. Granted, that song came out in 1977, but “Minions: The Rise of Gru” uses Lipps Inc.’s 1980 banger, “Funkytown” not once, but twice.</p> <p>After braving death to retrieve the gems, Wild Knuckles is betrayed by team member Belle Bottom (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/taraji-p-henson\">Taraji P. Henson</a>), who cruelly explains that honor among thieves is a myth before dropping him to his presumed death from their plane. With her ever-changing wardrobe and enormous Afro, (which is animated with an impressive amount of texture) Belle looks like Cleopatra Jones. The other four members have equally pun-based names. There’s Stronghold (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/danny-trejo\">Danny Trejo</a>), a nunchaku-wielding nun named Nun-Chuck (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/lucy-lawless\">Lucy Lawless</a>), the Nordic strongman Svengeance (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/dolph-lundgren\">Dolph Lundgren</a>), and a dude with an enormous lobster claw for a hand. His name is Jean-Clawed and he’s voiced by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/steven-seagal\">Steven Seagal</a>. Just kidding! He’s voiced by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jean-claude-van-damme\">Jean-Claude Van Damme</a>. I told you this movie wasn’t that clever.</p> <p>Now that the much-older Wild Knuckles is out of the picture, The Vicious 6—I mean Five—are looking for a much younger replacement. Gru applies for the position and receives a response housed in a self-destructing 8-track tape. He enters the record store that secretly houses Belle Bottom’s lair, meeting his future colleague Dr. Nefario (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/russell-brand\">Russell Brand</a>) in the process. Nefario gives Gru a 45 of <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/linda-ronstadt\">Linda Ronstadt</a>’s cover of “You’re No Good,” the key to entering the secret hideout. Since he’s barely out of junior high, Gru is dismissed, but not before stealing the Zodiac Stones. Belle and her crew pursue him in order to get them back.</p> <p>Believe it or not, there are two other plot-heavy stories in “Minions: The Rise of Gru.” One concerns the surviving Wild Knuckles’ San Francisco-based quest for revenge, and the other involves the Minions learning kung fu from Master Chow (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/michelle-yeoh\">Michelle Yeoh</a>) in order to save Gru after he’s been kidnapped. Well, those two kind of go together; Gru’s been taken by Wild Knuckles in an attempt to retrieve what’s rightfully his. Unbeknownst to Mr. Knuckles, Otto, the newest, and most talkative of the Minions, has traded the jewelry for a pet rock. As punishment, Gru is subjected to a type of torture I would happily endure: He’s tied to a giant record player that will spin, for 48 hours straight, the greatest disco song ever recorded, the Andrea True Connection’s “More More More.”</p> <p>“Don’t call my mother for ransom,” Gru begs, “she will probably pay you to keep me.” Gru’s mean ol’ Mom is once again played by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/julie-andrews\">Julie Andrews</a>, who characteristically has no use for her son nor his henchmen. The Vicious 6 show up to extract a pound of flesh from her anyway. Seeing the star of “The Sound of Music” get her ass kicked by a nun is my kind of meta! That’s one way to solve a problem like Maria, I tell ya!</p> <p>As with “Minions,” “Minions: The Rise of Gru” moves at breakneck speed. This time, however, it’s a tad less exhausting and actually works to the film’s advantage. The laughs are well-paced and the viewer isn’t given too much time to reflect on how ridiculous <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/matthew-fogel\">Matthew Fogel</a>’s screenplay is. The animation is striking, from the gorgeously rendered Chinatown of the City by the Bay to the charming look of young Gru. He has the same big, expressive eyes that fill the emotional faces of his “little gurls.” Carell does a fine job of making his Gru voice younger and less pronounced. Henson and the rest of the cast sound like they’re having a blast, and their enthusiasm is infectious.</p> <p>Even if you can’t stand the Minions (who are once again voiced in “Minionese” by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/pierre-coffin\">Pierre Coffin</a>), you might find this one tolerable. Especially if you’re old enough to get the 1976 jokes yet feel young enough to find bemusement in all the goofy slapstick. If nothing else, everything gets tied up neatly in a bow, bringing the DMU up-to-date, thereby making any further films unnecessary. That is, unless this one makes a ton of money. </p> <p><em>Now playing in theaters.</em></p> <p>Article URL: <a

href=\"https://srad.jp/story/22/06/27/1527240/\">中絶に関して憲法違反であるとの判断</a>がおこなわれたことで、様々な混乱が起きている。先の判断により女性の中絶権が合衆国憲法で保障されなくなったことにより、一部の州に存在していた中絶手術を提供してきた「中絶クリニック」の閉鎖が始まった。ケンタッキー、ルイジアナ、アーカンソー、サウスダコタ、ミズーリ、オクラホマ、アラバマの各州では、最高裁判決を受けて中絶禁止法が施行されたという。他州でも同様の法律が成立する可能性が高いそうだ（<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/japanese/61934070\">BBC</a>）。<br> <br> これに合わせてGoogleは7月1日、「ロケーション履歴」から、クリニックなどの訪問履歴を自動削除する処理をおこなうと発表した。ロケーション履歴を有効化していた場合、カウンセリングセンター、家庭内暴力シェルター、中絶クリニック、不妊治療センター、依存症治療施設、減量クリニック、美容外科クリニックといったプライバシーの度合いの高い施設を訪問した場合、システム側が識別し、訪問後すぐにロケーション履歴から削除するとしている。この処理は向こう数週間で有効になるとしている（<a

href=\"https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2207/04/news060.html\">ITmedia</a>）。<br> <br> また今回の判決の影響で、性暴力で妊娠した10歳の少女が中絶手術を拒否され、州外へ渡航を余儀なくされる事態なども報じられている。このほかこの判断の影響で、問題の多い中絶薬の使用がむしろこれまで以上に増えるのではないかとする指摘も出ている（<a

Joey Izzo’s film uses a recorded interview from 1970 to recount events that took place over four days in what is essentially a torture chamber disguised as a self-help seminar meant to get to the heart of everyone’s “truth.” That part is left purposefully vague, but what happens to a group of men in this dire situation is presented rather explicitly through the recorded interview, reenactment and animation (the cast must have been relieved for the animated segments). </p> <p>The man giving his testimony is named Gene Church (played in the reenactments by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/phil-burgers\">Phil Burgers</a>), who was told that if he wanted to move up into management he and a few other gentlemen had to complete a four-day self-improvement seminar, completely unaware of what it entailed. The seminar did not take place in a conference room of the hotel, but rather in a dark basement where the men saw a coffin, animal cages, and a cross to hang on. One man spends the night in the coffin while the other men take turns watching over him. Many of them are forced to be nude and to commit unspeakable acts of violence and degradation to one another. </p> <p>What is the point, you ask? That’s what Izzo saves for last, but suffice to say, such self-improvement seminars like this still exist today and that this may have been the start of it all. The interview we are hearing is not meant for pubic ears and Gene is very matter-of-fact about his involvement as well as his own torturous experience. The kinds of fraudulent people who profit from sadistic means of self-awakening would rather you not see their practices ahead of time before they get your money. What happens to Gene at the end might have been a breakthrough (we never know), but at what cost? How much of this will end up haunting him in the long run? My guess: All of it. </p> <p>Izzo’s film leaves a lot for the viewer to decide, but the film is a hypnotic retelling of this insanity. Obviously, the interview in and of itself is compelling enough, but Izzo smartly mixes between grainy, 16mm reenactment and animation that does just enough to convey some of the more disgusting acts that took place. The film never lingers too long on one visual element or the other. It’s a consistent mix and with just the right rhythm so that the transitions look seamless. Burgers, a brave actor for doing this, gives the film's central, wordless performance and carries it well and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/pat-healy\">Pat Healy</a>, who plays the “lead instructor,” looks like he would be perfect for the role if they ever did a feature-length dramatization; creepy, charismatic and piercing.</p> <p>“You Have Never Been Completely Honest” is a strong piece of work that really gets under your skin. It’s the only time at the Chicago Critics Film Festival when I had to give the audience a trigger warning beforehand. Consider yourself warned. </p> <figure style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62c33fc4306fcc71f362d1bd/content_Joey_Izzo_HEADSHOT.jpg\" data-image=\"[object Object]\" style=\"width: 389px; height: 486px;\" width=\"389\" height=\"486\"></figure> <p><strong>Q&A with director Joey Izzo</strong></p> <p><strong>How did you find this interview? What more can you tell me about it?</strong></p> <p>I found the interview from a past-participant of Leadership Dynamics that I met on an unrelated forum that is now defunct. Basically, I posed as a sympathetic and curious student of the founder William Penn Patrick and was able to get a hold of it that way. Later on, when I made contact with Gene Church, he told me more about the exact circumstances of the interview and I felt like it was safe to proceed with his blessing.</p> <p><strong>How did you go about shaping this interview into a 10-minute film? What interested you the most about it?</strong></p> <p>The whole interview was about 40 minutes, but it was pretty clear to me what was going to work for my use of it. I was most interested in Gene’s interpretation of the events on the day of his ordeal. I focused mainly on those portions of the interview and tried to re-edit it for narrative flow and shape. I really wanted to stick to the facts of what happened to him and make it feel subjective to his experience. I also tried to sporadically use the interview questions whenever I felt like he would be addressing concerns that the viewing audience might be asking themselves. Then, I went back in and tried to set the whole thing up with just enough expositional information as needed to clue the audience in on the specifics without getting too lost in the weeds.</p> <p><strong>What did you use to film the reenactments to help give it that aged look? </strong></p> <p>It was a combination of things. We shot on 16mm and chose a very fast stock, then we “push-processed” it a couple of stops, which is when you purposefully underexpose it and then increase exposure in the development process. This combination created the “unearthed from a damp basement” look we were going for. I also did a lot of scaling in the edit, which brought out a lot more artifacts.</p> <p><strong>Directing the reenactments must have been difficult. What was the atmosphere like on the set?</strong> </p> <p>Honestly it was a breeze! I tried to anticipate any unknown issues in performance during the casting process. I know I wanted Phil Burgers and Pat Healy in this. I’m a fan of both of them. Phil I knew, but Pat I was introduced to through a mutual friend. I had long conversations with both of them and worked it all out in terms of process and intentions. The rest of the cast was made up of actors I had worked with before and a troupe of clowns that performed together alongside Phil for years. So I knew there would be a built in comfort and trust among them. They are all fearless performers and nothing I instructed them to do was ever a problem. Plus, everyone had copies of the storyboards and a “demo video” that I made long before we shot. So they knew exactly what was going to be asked of them, down to the exact frame and timing of the shot.</p> <figure><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/62c33fe7306fcc71fc62cfae/content_YNBCH_Izzo_10.jpg\" data-image=\"[object Object]\"></figure> <p><strong>How did the animation aspect of the film get woven in? </strong></p> <p>I made a demo video (basically an \"animatic\") for the entire short out of illustrated storyboards. I went through the video and picked out shots that would be entirely reenactment, shots that would be entirely animated, and shots that would have elements of both. Dusty and Taylor from Mortis Studio came on board months before the reenactment shoot, so I was able to base the look of the animated characters on the people I casted, along with the location, props, etc. I was also able to provide them with background plates that we grabbed during the reenactment shoot. Taylor, Dusty and I were very interested in an interwoven and layered look for the animation, akin to <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/ralph-bakshi\">Ralph Bakshi</a>, so it was really important for us to feed off of each other throughout the production. </p> <p><strong>Have you ever talked with anyone who had been through a seminar like this (maybe not as torturous, but just intense)?</strong></p> <p>Oh yes, I’ve talked to many people that have taken various seminars around this time and even a few that took Leadership Dynamics training. There is no ambiguity regarding the L.D.I. training, every graduate I’ve spoken with corroborates Gene’s account of the events, even past trainers. I’ve also found court testimony from the founder of L.D.I. William Penn Patrick in which he downright brags about it. It’s important to recognize L.D.I. as a forerunner for subsequent groups, but that’s not to say that all seminar experiences are like this (though some are! even today).

Going “from dad bod to god bod” (to quote Waititi’s voiceover recap, delivered by his still-charming rock-bodied softy character Korg), Thor has lost the gut he had in “<a href=\"/reviews/avengers-endgame-2019\">Avengers: Endgame</a>,” and the people of Asgard have settled into a port town called New Asgard after their home realm was trashed in “Thor: Ragnarok.” Their leader, the charismatic King Valkyrie (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/tessa-thompson\">Tessa Thompson</a>), has helped them acclimate to life on Earth, which includes being a tourist attraction. With the assistance from the Guardians of the Galaxy in a brief appearance, Thor gets back into worlds-saving shape, and in a Guns ’n’ Roses-accompanied moment in the beginning, he unleashes stylized, high-flying slaughter a la many scenes in “Thor: Ragnarok,” with his axe Stormbreaker. But he has no one to share the victory with, and for all of the hundreds of years Thor has lived, he has resigned to not finding true love.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>The film then re-introduces a more interesting hero in Jane Foster (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/natalie-portman\">Natalie Portman</a>), Thor's past human love interest from the previous films during his more serious days. Now, she wields the restored pieces of Thor’s hammer Mjolnir, turning into the Mighty Thor with helmet and cape, but all with a price. Every time she uses the power, it takes away from her human capacity, which is all the more devastating given that we learn she has Stage Four cancer. “Thor: Love and Thunder” thoughtfully reinstates Jane into the action, while giving some more depth to her relationship with Thor. In both her human and her heroic state, Portman’s performance conveys why it's great to see Jane again. </p> <p>The adversary this time around is Gorr the God Butcher, a tortured character filled with vengeance who provides the shadows to the movie's immense moments of light. After the death of his daughter turns him into a non-believer, Gorr is chosen by a weapon called the Necrosword, and creates an army of shapeshifting black beasts to kill all gods, starting with the one who ignored his cries for help. <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/christian-bale\">Christian Bale</a> is striking in the role, fluctuating between high and low voices, relishing the chance to brandish his sharp teeth. It’s the closest we’ll get to seeing him play Pennywise the Clown, with a dash of Voldemort, but tethered to the same humility Bale brings to his most human, humbled characters. He can be mighty fun to watch, even when “Thor: Love and Thunder” undersells his god butchering for the sake of a more sentimental message, and to make him share scenes with frightened children.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Co-written by Waititi and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jennifer-kaytin-robinson\">Jennifer Kaytin Robinson</a>, “Thor: Love and Thunder” just doesn’t truly flourish like it could. Part of its messiness kicks in with its big conflict, when Gorr the God Butcher attacks New Asgard at night in a frantic impromptu fight scene that has Waititi's usually stable vision for Thor action losing control. The supposedly scary scene just happens, and it’s difficult to follow in the dark what’s going on, as shadow creatures wage battle on the Asgardians and kidnap their children. The sequence is so disjointed that a visual gag involving a collapsing burning building in the background—timed for when Thor meets-cute again with Jane as a hammer-wielding, ass-kicking, Mighty Thor—just doesn’t work.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>In order to save the stolen children and stop Gorr, Jane, Thor, King Valkyrie, and Korg visit the god of lightning Zeus and the other Gods, who laze about in a golden forum and talk about the next orgy, unafraid of what Gorr is looking to do to them. Like a golden and white version of the Galactic Senate in “<a href=\"/reviews/great-movie-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-1977\">Star Wars</a>,” with a grab-bag of goofy creatures (one has furry feet and a face, that it; another is a Korg relative) it makes for one of the more eye-popping set pieces. But it’s also a moment in which the movie is building toward other “<a href=\"/reviews/thor-2011\">Thor</a>” stories at the detriment of this one, including a shrugging cameo seen in the post-credits. It’s also a moment among many in which it's clear that Tessa Thompson’s character of King Valkyrie, though important with the goings-on of New Asgard, has oddly been pushed to the side despite her established importance and swagger in “Thor: Ragnarok.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>“Thor: Love and Thunder” flirts with when a call-back story beat or joke is just playing the hits, the same way that there are a millions Guns ’n Roses nods and needle drops in this movie just because, and you’re expected to head-bang each time. All of its pop culture ad libs, or punched-up superhero stuff about coming up with catchphrases—when those jokes feel safe instead of left-field, they fall particularly flat. “Thor: Love and Thunder” is a blockbuster comedy sequel at its core, and its weaker material reminds you of that even when it’s still good for a sporadic laugh or two.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Lacking the overall freshness that defined the previous movie, “Thor: Love and Thunder” is better with its bolder, dramatic sequences that are like mini movies expressed with action figures about how love comes with the price of loss. Gorr is introduced in a harrowing piece of bubble gum <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/ingmar-bergman\">Ingmar Bergman</a>, cradling his dead child and renouncing his god before killing him, all before the Marvel Studios credit card kicks in with electric guitars. Later on, Waititi presents us the Jane and Thor romance—its coziness and later its isolation—as like a spin-off of his own quirky indie “Eagle vs. Shark.” It's very funny in some moments, but with a brutal honesty always in frame, especially as the two then see if love is salvageable in the current dwindling timeline. Along with Jane’s striking cancer storyline, its these heartfelt moments too that reveal the true motivators behind “Thor: Love and Thunder,” even if everything is later treated in too quaint, or too eagerly crowd-pleasing a fashion to hit as hard as they’re clearly meant to.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>The biggest takeaway from “Thor: Love and Thunder,” aside from how Waititi really should get that “Star Wars” trilogy he’s been teasing, involves his bold usage of color, visually and thematically. It’s not just the eye-popping hues, which here include soldiers for Zeus who spew golden blood, or a bravura black-and-white fight sequence between Gorr and Thor on a tiny color-draining planet that uses select flashes of blue light with great effect. It’s that assured sense of tone that preaches how a movie can mix god-killing and kid-friendly crowd-pleasing moments with a gooey message about love. This sequel is not without its reservations, but Waititi continues to show just how unique these blockbusters can still be, provided their storytellers keep embracing some of their heaviest and funniest ideas. <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><em>Available in theaters on July 8th.</em></p> <p>Article URL: <a
