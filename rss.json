Fun, smart, and sneakily deep, it has elements that will be familiar to families around the world. There’s a little bit of “<a href=\"/reviews/moana-2016\">Moana</a>,” a backdrop of “Pirates of the Caribbean,” a thread of “<a href=\"/reviews/how-to-train-your-dragon-2010\">How to Train Your Dragon</a>,” and even a few nods to Kaiju movies in this rollicking animated movie that features some actual filmmaking instead of just bright colors to hold the attention of little kids. The action scenes have been very carefully constructed and considered, but it’s the script that will sneak up on you with themes worth discussing with the kids when it’s over. “You can be a hero and still be wrong” isn’t exactly a brand-new theme in adventure fiction, but it feels like a more important one in today’s world, and it’s nice to see a fantasy film for families that doesn’t talk down to kids. The animated films that have sustained history are the ones that trust children to follow complex plots and themes. It’s great to see that kind of trust reemerge in a film that never forgets to be entertaining too.</p> <p><a href=\"/cast-and-crew/chris-williams\">Chris Williams</a> (who co-directed “<a href=\"/reviews/big-hero-6-2014\">Big Hero 6</a>” and “Moana”) makes his confident solo debut with a script he co-wrote with Neil Benjamin that subverts classic seafaring adventure mythology. After a brief prologue that introduces us to Maisie (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/zaris-angel-hator\">Zaris-Angel Hator</a>) as she flees her orphanage in search of greater adventure, Williams and his team stage an impressive battle at sea between two monster-hunting ships and a massive beast. Immediately, there’s a sense that the craftsmanship here is high as the sequence unfolds with the swooping tentacles of a Kraken-esque beast and the ships trying to defeat it. “The Sea Beast” takes place in the middle of a great war between monsters and men, the latter funded by a King (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jim-carter\">Jim Carter</a>) and Queen (Doon Mackichan) who clearly don’t mind putting people in harm’s way but would never risk their own safety. </p> <p>The other hero of this tall tale is Jacob Holland (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/karl-urban\">Karl Urban</a>, finding a nice vulnerable heroism in his voice work), a boy who grew up on a hunting ship called the Inevitable, run by the ruthless Captain Crow (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jared-harris\">Jared Harris</a>). The Ahab of this tale, Crow represents the old guard hunter, someone who has been doing this so long that he’s obsessed with hunting the creature that took his eye, no matter the cost. When Maisie stows away on their ship as they hunt said sea beast, a red giant known as the Bluster, everything changes. Through a series of action-driven events, Maisie and Jacob discover that everything they’ve been told about the battle between man and monster has been a myth. </p> <p>To be fair, “The Sea Beast” take a bit too long to build up steam, and there’s a tighter 100-minute version of this film buried in the one that runs almost two hours. I wanted to tighten it up in a few places, and I do wish the world-building felt a little stronger. Some of the locations also feel thinly designed, although if all the time and budget went to the beautifully rendered monsters than that’s understandable. </p> <p>Most of all, and this is rare nowadays in American animation, I admired the script of “The Sea Beast,” one that intertwines those aforementioned obvious influences into something refreshingly daring. This movie takes narrative risks in that it’s a monster-hunting movie that’s ultimately anti-violence.

The riveting “Black Bird” sustains six hours of tension in its telling of a remarkable true story in which a convict was convinced to get closer to a serial killer to make sure he stayed behind bars. A story told both behind bars and with the investigators on the outside, this is a smart, thrilling piece of television, heavily elevated by the writing of the great <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/dennis-lehane\">Dennis Lehane</a> (“<a href=\"/reviews/mystic-river-2003\">Mystic River</a>,” “<a href=\"/reviews/shutter-island-2010\">Shutter Island</a>,” “<a href=\"/reviews/gone-baby-gone-2007\">Gone Baby Gone</a>”). “<a href=\"/reviews/rocket-man-1997\">Rocket Man</a>” star <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/taron-egerton\">Taron Egerton</a> flexes his acting muscles in a way he’s never been allowed to before, <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/ray-liotta\">Ray Liotta</a> gives a moving final performance, and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/greg-kinnear\">Greg Kinnear</a> does his best work in years in a show that transcends the true crime genre to become a character study of a man who is forced to befriend pure evil to ensure it doesn’t escape.</p> <p>Lehane adapts the nonfiction book <em>In With the Devil: A Fallen Hero, A Serial Killer, and a Dangerous Bargain for Redemption</em> by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/james-keene\">James Keene</a>, who is played here by Egerton. A petty criminal, Keene is busted with enough drugs and guns in his possession to get him ten years behind bars, a sentence that likely means he won’t see the final days of his sick father, a former cop known as Big Jim (Liotta). When a detective named Lauren McCauley (an excellent <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/sepideh-moafi\">Sepideh Moafi</a>) comes to him with a proposal, he listens. It’s an incredibly dangerous idea that will take Keene from a minimum-security holding facility to maximum-security facility for the criminally insane, where he will be surrounded by murderers and career sociopaths. But it will not only lead to Keene’s release but potentially save lives. </p> <p>McCauley is working with another detective named <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/brian-miller\">Brian Miller</a> (Kinnear) on the case of an alleged serial killer named Larry Hall (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/paul-walter-hauser\">Paul Walter Hauser</a>). They got him for now, but Hall has a pending appeal that looks like it might be successful, so they need more. Hall has been the suspect in multiple murders across the Midwest, but he’s one of those guys who never tells the same story twice. His twin brother Garry (a phenomenal Jake McLaughlin) and other detectives think that Hall is just a broken storyteller, one of those guys who confesses to things he didn’t do. Miller thinks he’s a true monster who is playing games, and that Hall did commit these horrible rapes and murders. As he investigates recent disappearances that could be Hall’s crimes, Jimmy Keene is moved to a cell near the potential monster, left in an incredibly dangerous situation wherein hardly anybody in the prison knows why he’s there. When he’s not dodging a corrupt guard or navigating the convict power structure, Keene has to slowly get Hall to open up, knowing what he finds inside will be absolutely horrific. </p> <p>Lehane’s dialogue is sharp from the first scene to the last of the six-episode “Black Bird,” and the entire ensemble comes to life through his words. Egerton finds the perfect balance between grit and vulnerability. He’s just an opportunist criminal, not someone who wants to discuss the rape and murder of children. Egerton captures the emotional stakes of having to listen to a monster in ways that recall Netflix’s excellent “Mindhunter,” which also seems like an influence on the procedural stuff that goes down with McCauley & Miller. Kinnear has a flinty intellectualism that fits the character perfectly, someone who pushes a little harder than the cops who seem to be too willing to believe that Hall is a serial confessor. Hauser is a bit more of a mixed bag. Likely true to the real guy, he plays Hall with a high-pitched affect that can sometimes be like a crutch or even a distraction. He’s better when he’s not leaning into the broadness of Hall’s physicality and vocal tics, particularly in the fifth episode, which is nearly a two-hander between Hauser and Egerton. Finally, there’s the heartbreaking work from Liotta, who was actually ill on set. He imbues his concerned, dying father with a truth that serves as an emotional backdrop for everything that happens on the show. </p> <p>Another rewarding thing about “Black Bird” is how it uses its six-episode space. We’re in an era of the limited series in which most shows aren’t the best length, too often structured like a film script stretched to meet a mini-series form. But “Black Bird” uses its time to get under your skin. Keene knows he can’t just go into prison and start just asking questions of Hall, who would suspect that his pending appeal could be sabotaged. He has to befriend him over days, and the structure of “Black Bird” allows that slow burn to be genuine, as accompanied by a great score by Mogwai. It also helps greatly that Egerton is always in the moment, conveying Keene’s mental state through a nervous glance or gritted jaw. It’s a great performance. </p> <p>Its release in the era of a national obsession with true crime could lead people to dismiss “Black Bird,” but this show is worth your time even if you don’t usually buy into the genre. It reminded me more of rich, character-driven material like “<a href=\"/reviews/the-night-of-2016\">The Night Of</a>” than so many of the “ripped from the headlines” mini-series of late. It has the weight of some of Lehane’s best fiction, even though it’s all so disturbingly true. </p> <p><em>Premieres with two episodes on Apple TV+ today and then one a week.

In a sense, that statement sums up this quietly startling movie directed by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/antoneta-alamat-kusijanovi\">Antoneta Alamat Kusijanović</a>.<br></p> <p>Julija’s relationship with her father, Ante, is fraught. It seems as if Ante’s relationship with everyone in his life is fraught. They live with Nela, Julija’s mom, on a scenic Croatian island. It’s all sloping landscapes, old stone buildings, blue water, and blue sky. A yacht of partying young people has docked near the family’s house, and Ante (a grizzled, bearded Leon Lucev) curses them out. Cursing people out seems his default mode of communication. </p> <p>The coming evening is a special one. Ante is eager to welcome his old friend Javier (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/cliff-curtis\">Cliff Curtis</a>), a master of industry and wheeler-dealer of the first stripe, to dinner. He hopes to sell his land to “Javi” and quit the spear-fishing life (the movie’s title is a word for a Mediterranean moray eel) for an apartment in Zagreb. Julija, for all intents and purposes a kind of mermaid, bristles at the notion of life away from the sea. </p> <p>Both her mother and father take exception to her walking around the house and its grounds in her white one-piece bathing suit. Ante makes an offensive remark, mother Nela (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/danica-curcic\">Danica Curcic</a>) tells Julija she’s “naked.” The statuesque Filipović plays a young woman who’s fairly unselfconscious of her body despite being at an age where everyone else seems unable NOT to notice it (including one of the mooks on the party yacht). And when the rugged, worldly Javier arrives, he notices it too. </p> <p>Not in anything like an overtly creepy way. But as his visit goes on, Julija learns about the past shared not just by Javier and Ante, but Nela as well. Rooting through Javier’s travel bag, she is bemused to find a copy of <em>Business Week</em> with Javier as the cover star in it. She discovers a potentially more unsettling object as well. Her interactions with the adult trio only stoke her rebelliousness, punching and poking at her sense of self. While she loves the water, she can’t really take her family anymore. And as Ante experiences her increasing disdain for him, he himself grows increasingly brutal.</p> <p>Kusijanovic and cinematographer <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/h%C3%A9l%C3%A8ne-louvart\">Hélène Louvart</a> share an acute eye for landscapes; this widescreen film is best appreciated on as expansive a screen as possible. \"Murina\" is a slow burn of a movie, one that doesn’t end in a detonation but with an enigma.

How you deal with this reality says a lot about who you are: how do you make sense of the narrative of your life, how do you fit your own past into your present story? This is the central tension of Claire Denis' emotionally volatile and unpredictable \"Both Sides of the Blade,\" with Juliet Binoche and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/vincent-lindon\">Vincent Lindon</a> giving two tremendous performances as a contented couple whose lives are exploded by a chance encounter in the street, by the past strolling back into the present, re-asserting its primacy with no warning. The past is the ultimate party-crasher.</p> <p>This is Denis' third collaboration with Binoche (\"<a href=\"/reviews/let-the-sunshine-in-2018\">Let the Sunshine In</a>\" and \"<a href=\"/reviews/high-life-2019\">High Life</a>\"), and here she has teamed up again with <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/christine-angot\">Christine Angot</a> (who co-wrote \"Let the Sunshine In\") to craft a script out of Angot's 2018 novel <em>Un Tournant de la vie</em>. Angot's novel is mostly dialogue, which is reflected in the \"talky\" screenplay, where the language is finely wrought and intricately observed, spiked with indirection, avoidance, and blatant lying (to each other, and to themselves). When the truth comes out, it bursts forth messily after being trapped so long in a container. \"Both Sides of the Blade\" has had multiple titles in its production history (it is still listed as \"<a href=\"/reviews/fire-1997\">Fire</a>\" on IMDb), but the final version came from a song by Tindersticks (who did the moody score). The original French title has a certain blunt panache: \"Avec Amour et Acharnement\": \"With Love and Relentlessness,\" but when Denis heard \"Both Sides of the Blade\" during the editing process, she thought it most appropriate for this story of passion's sharpness and danger.</p> <p>Seen in the opening sequences, floating together in a blue ocean, Sara (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/juliette-binoche\">Juliette Binoche</a>) and Jean (Vincent Lindon) are not just a happy couple. They are in a blissfully contented and satiated couple. Too good to be true? Denis does not undercut the bliss with foreshadowing. She presents it straight. She presents everything straight. There is no exposition, since human beings don't go around providing exposition to people who already know the story. We have to piece together what happened.</p> <p>Sara is the host of a radio show, where she interviews serious people about serious subjects, war, racism, global politics. Jean is out of work, finding it difficult to get past the barriers in place due to his criminal history and past prison term (for a crime never disclosed). He makes the rounds of employment agencies, while fielding constant phone calls from his mother (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/bulle-ogier\">Bulle Ogier</a>). Jean's son from a previous marriage, Marcus (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/issa-perica\">Issa Perica</a>), lives with his grandmother and things are not going well. The day after Sara and Jean come back from vacation, she gets a glimpse of a man on the street, and she stops dead in her tracks, stricken. He is François (<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/gr%C3%A9goire-colin\">Grégoire Colin</a>), an old friend of both Sara's and Jean's, and Sara's former flame.</p> <p>Sara is completely undone by this one glance. It opens up an abyss in her life, an abyss that didn't seem to exist only a day before. Who François is—and what happened between them—is revealed in a riveting conversation between Sara and Jean, when she tells him she saw François on the street. She's overtly casual about it, but Jean is immediately alert to the crackling undercurrent. From then on, nothing is the same.</p> <p>This is the stuff of Sirk-ian melodrama, where \"the problems of three little people\" definitely amount to \"a hill of beans.\" \"Both Sides of the Blade\" is a romance, a love triangle, a marriage drama, an infidelity narrative, all familiar ground, but Denis' approach is her own. The characters exist in airtight bell jars—together, and then separately—making connection nearly impossible. The film is inside that bell jar, often breathlessly claustrophobic in its focus. Denis, and her cinematographer <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/%C3%A9ric-gautier\">Éric Gautier</a>, don't give us a break from these people. The camera is right up in the faces of Binoche and Lindon, drinking in every pause, every tiny shift of mood or feeling, the camera almost an intrusion, a Grand Inquisitor.</p> <p>When Jean and François team up in a business venture, Sara cracks apart, and Jean, in turn, cracks with her. Their behavior is often incomprehensible, but love is not known for encouraging sanity. There are moments when \"Both Sides of the Blade\" feels like a ghost story, where Sara's love affair with François is the ghost haunting the current couple, but there were other times when it feels like a drug narrative. The look on Sara's face when she sees François is not the look of a woman yearning for a past boyfriend. It's the look of an addict, white-knuckling her way through sobriety, gazing at the drug she still misses. The conversations between Sara and Jean, as they hash out this situation (or fail to), are the meat and potatoes of this tale. Their scenes together are heart-breaking, honest, sometimes scary.</p> <p>On Sara and Jean's periphery, are smaller characters: the grandmother, baffled at her son's absence, and completely at her wits' end having to deal with a bored lackluster teenager (who is, understandably, pissed at being abandoned by both of his parents). Regular Denis collaborator, and now director herself, <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/mati-diop\">Mati Diop</a>, has a small role as an empathetic family friend, who sees what is happening with the mixed-race Marcus, the subtleties of which his immediate family miss (or don't want to perceive, if judging by some of Jean's comments).</p> <p>Denis is sensitive to environment and atmosphere. Consider Sara and Jean's apartment. We really only see the bedroom, where Sara spends so much time lying in bed, her back to the camera. There doesn't seem to be a lot of space. The balcony, looking out on the city roofs, is a huge presence: It's a No-Man's-Land, a neutral space, where the warring couple can come back together. But it's also a place of escape and secrets. Consider, too, Jean's driving. He spends so much time driving back and forth between his apartment and his mother's, outside of the city. He does his grocery shopping out near his mother's house. But he never stays to visit, and avoids his son. This \"quirk\" is never mentioned outright but it's fascinating. Why drive over an hour to go grocery-shopping, right down the street from your mother's house, and not stop by to say hello? Maybe being behind the wheel gives Jean a sense of control he lacks everywhere else.</p> <p>Lindon gave one of my favorite performances of 2021 in \"<a href=\"/reviews/titane-movie-review-2021\">Titane</a>,\" as the steroid-pumped tender-souled fire chief with the big tragic eyes, and he is superb here as well. There's something broken in Jean, and perhaps he didn't realize just how bad it was until Sara says, too casually, \"I saw François today.\" He is also drawn to his old friend, a sketchy guy who represents an entryway into the criminal underworld again. When Jean accuses Sara of being in François' \"grip,\" she could say the same thing to him. And Binoche is all raw nerves. It's a destabilizing kind of performance, because she lies, to herself and to Jean, so much so that when she speaks the truth it sounds like a lie. She is so placid and competent in the opening scenes, and the mask falls away so completely when she sees François that you wonder how she managed to carry on with this new relationship at all, let alone for a decade.</p> <p>There's an urgency in all of these confrontations and contradictions. Every moment is life or death. It's exhausting, but again: Love is not known for being sedate. Sara has intricate conversations with heavy-hitting intellectuals on her radio show, but falls apart when trying to be forthright with her intimate partner. Jean is loving and kind to Sara, but avoids his struggling son. Sara loves Jean, but can also say with a straight face that he is \"controlling\" her, even though we have seen little to no evidence of that. Perception is all. If she feels it, she feels it. The truth is different depending on where you stand, and in a bell jar there's not enough room for everyone. No matter which way you try to make a move, you bump into someone else.</p> <p>Love is patient and kind, or so they say. \"Both Sides of the Blade\" knows that love is actually a wrecking ball.</p> <p><em>Now playing in select theaters.</em></p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/both-sides-of-the-blade-2022\">https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/both-sides-of-the-blade-2022</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-08T09:12:25.000Z"},{"id":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022","url":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022","title":"This Much I Know to Be True","content_html":"<blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com\">All Content</a> <strong>This Much I Know to Be True</strong></p> <p>by Brian Tallerico </p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022/thumb_this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022.jpeg\" /></p><p>More than a mere concert movie, the excellent “This Much I Know to Be True,” on Mubi today, is a collaboration between three artists—<a href=\"/cast-and-crew/nick-cave\">Nick Cave</a>, <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/warren-ellis\">Warren Ellis</a>, and filmmaker <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/andrew-dominik\">Andrew Dominik</a>. The director worked with Cave before on the stunning “<a href=\"/reviews/one-more-time-with-feeling-2016\">One More Time with Feeling</a>” and continues what feels more like an artistic union than a mere musical document. Once again, he captures how Cave and Ellis almost seem like they’re channeling something bigger than themselves. Cave always felt like an old-fashioned conjurer, someone who allowed the spirit to move him on his early albums with the Bad Seeds. Since the tragic death of his son in 2015, his music has found a different register, something that seems to be grappling with existence and meaning in ways that musicians rarely do. His most recent albums with The Bad Seeds (the masterpiece <em>Ghosteen</em>) and just Ellis (<em>Carnage</em>) come to life in this film, shot on location in London and Brighton.</p> <p>Filming in Spring 2021 before Cave & Ellis were to go on tour, “This Much I Know to Be True” opens with an unusual prologue wherein Cave jokes that he’s going to transition from music to ceramics, showing off a series he made about the devil. Through a display of his work, a story unfolds about the existence of the devil. No matter what Cave does, he’s telling a story, whether it’s through ceramics or music, and everything he’s done recently feels like it’s reaching for something true about the human condition. Some of the best moments in “This Much I Know to Be True” reveal the organic nature of Cave & Ellis’ process, in which they will work on songs in a way that's more like pulling it out of the air instead of it being put on the page. More than the previous Cave films, “This Much I Know to Be True” clarifies the dynamic between Cave & Ellis, and how essential the latter is to these songs. </p> <p>Of course, most of “This Much I Know to Be True” is music. Dominik sets up a circular track for his camera in the rehearsal space, which has a soft white light on the top third of the screen that adds to an almost holy nature of the recording. Dominik and his brilliant cinematographer <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/robbie-ryan\">Robbie Ryan</a> (“<a href=\"/reviews/the-favourite-2018\">The Favourite</a>”) move their camera around the room in a way that's in tune with the performances, whether it’s sweeping in on a falsetto note or staying static on an emotional moment. “This Much I Know to Be True” is masterfully directed, an example of when a filmmaker and a musician are working in unison creatively instead of just going through the motions. </p> <p>There are carefully considered interludes between the songs of “This Much I Know to Be True.” In one, Cave discusses his work with The Red Hand Files, a way that he communicates with his fans about his work, his grief, and the meaning of life. Cave says that the project has made him a better man, and one can see that in his work. For Cave, and a lot of artists and other sensitive souls, life is a search for truth. I read the title of this film as a reflection of that endeavor. All Nick Cave knows to be true is in his art, the music that digs deep into emotional reservoirs for both the performer and the listener to find something that can’t be expressed any other way. That’s a special kind of truth. </p> <p><em>On Mubi today.</em> </p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022\">https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/this-much-i-know-to-be-true-movie-review-2022</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-08T09:11:25.000Z"},{"id":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dreaming-walls-inside-the-chelsea-hotel-movie-review-2022","url":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dreaming-walls-inside-the-chelsea-hotel-movie-review-2022","title":"Dreaming Walls: Inside the Chelsea Hotel","content_html":"<blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com\">All Content</a> <strong>Dreaming Walls: Inside the Chelsea Hotel</strong></p> <p>by Marya E. Gates </p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/dreaming-walls-inside-the-chelsea-hotel-movie-review-2022/thumb_dreaming-walls-movie-review-2022.jpeg\" /></p><p>Built between 1883 and 1885, the Hotel Chelsea is perhaps one of the most famous—and infamous—buildings in New York City. Writers like <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/arthur-c-clarke\">Arthur C. Clarke</a> and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/allen-ginsberg\">Allen Ginsberg</a> wrote seminal works there. It was home to many musicians, filmmakers, and artists like <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/bob-dylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/stanley-kubrick\">Stanley Kubrick</a>, Willem de Kooning, and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jane-fonda\">Jane Fonda</a>. It’s where Nancy Spungen, girlfriend of Sid Vicious, was found stabbed to death, and where <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/dylan-thomas\">Dylan Thomas</a> spent his final days. A NYC landmark since 1966, the hotel no longer accepts long term residents and after a decades-long renovation, it has reopened as the city’s latest boutique destination. </p> <p>Amélie van Elmbt & <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/maya-duverdier\">Maya Duverdier</a>’s lyrical documentary “Dreaming Walls: Inside the Chelsea Hotel” is an elegy for the hotel’s past and a final look at the last of the residents who still reside within its walls. If only it weren’t as beguiled by the ghosts, past and present, that still haunt the hotel itself. </p> <p>Part a reverential history of the hotel, part a look at the complex situation for the remaining residents within the hotel during the drawn out renovation process, van Elmbt and Duverdier’s film is noticeably in love with the mythology and living history of the place. Beautifully photographed by cinematographers <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/joachim-philippe\">Joachim Philippe</a> and <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/virginie-surdej\">Virginie Surdej</a>, the film stalks the hallways, lingering on the cracks and other imperfections that will soon be smoothed away is reminiscent of <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/chantal-akerman\">Chantal Akerman</a>’s 1973 documentary “Hotel Monterey.” There is a certain undeniable beauty in this decay, an aesthetic made to be captured on film. But the reality of living within this decay is always just out of frame.</p> <p>There is a clear bias here towards the past bohemia the hotel represents. And there is a much greater focus on the myth that will be demolished by renovation, without much of an exploration into the reality of the squalor residents were living in. The residents who have resisted the renovations are framed with wonder and awe, while those who have agreed to settlements are painted in a much more negative light. The film is dedicated to “all those who once stayed at the Chelsea ... and to their dreams,” which is fitting because the filmmakers are more invested in the mythic qualities of its past than in interrogating the reality of gentrification. The same goes for the implications of what it means for the city, that a historic monument of such prominence as the Hotel Chelsea has been turned into yet another boutique hotel. </p> <p>In the foreword to the book <em>Hotel Chelsea: Living in the Last Bohemian Haven</em> by Colin Miller and Ray Mock, former child residents and sisters <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/gaby-hoffmann\">Gaby Hoffmann</a> and Alex Auder have a clear-eyed conversation of growing up in the hotel in all its majesty and its squalor. They reminisce about how their mother took refuge in the hotel because former manager Stanley Bard didn’t ask for a deposit or make them sign a lease. They also discuss the irony of rich people who moved into the hotel in the 2000s choosing to live the “bohemian” lifestyle they were forced to live by circumstance, in turn helping the owners slowly price out longtime residents. Within the story of the Chelsea is a larger story to be told about both the gentrification of both the building and of the art world. </p> <p>The one interview in “Dreaming Walls” that manages to successfully straddle the line between overwhelming nostalgia and the cost of gentrification comes from multimedia artist Steve Willis. What starts out as the story of how Willis snagged a residency in one of the rooms once occupied by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/janis-joplin\">Janis Joplin</a> after he produced a <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/mariah-carey\">Mariah Carey</a> music video in the hotel, ends with a tour of what he gave up in his settlement to remain a resident. Now a cramped studio, Willis lost a hallway, kitchen, and bathroom. Touring the section in the midst of renovation Willis shows the filmmakers a wall he painted blue and toothbrush holder that once held Joplin’s toothbrush, all set to be demolished. While the hotel itself will be marked using its past residents to lure people to spend $300 a night, these small details of its rich past are apparently not worth preserving. </p> <p>It’s in exploring the iconography of the hotel that the documentary shines the brightest. Van Elmbt and Duverdier are clearly well-versed in the works that were created on the grounds, or by former residents, and do their best to imbue their film with the same timeless cool that pulses through them. Excerpts from journal entries, novels, and other texts are read throughout the film. Imagery from films like Ronald Nameth’s “Andy Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable” (which, ironically, was actually filmed during a week of performances in Chicago) and footage of celebrity tenants like <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/patti-smith\">Patti Smith</a> are projected on the hotel’s decrepit walls, which is both an homage to filmmaker and Warhol collaborator <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/jonas-mekas\">Jonas Mekas</a>, who pioneered projecting film on walls during live performances, and a metaphor for the history that will forever permeate throughout the hotel. The collage effect is haunting and gorgeous, although it speaks more to the lasting power of the original art than it does their implementation here. </p> <p>If the goal of “Dreaming Walls” is to create one last kaleidoscopic portrait within the Chelsea before all of its soul and history is renovated away, packaged and sold as a destination for the bourgeoisie, van Elmbt and Duverdier manage to do just that, despite their film leaning more towards imitation than the truly innovative work they so revere. While it doesn’t quite rise to the artistic heights it aims for, “Dreaming Walls” will satisfy viewers who want to linger a little longer in storied halls of the Hotel Chelsea. </p> <p><em>Now playing in theaters.</em></p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dreaming-walls-inside-the-chelsea-hotel-movie-review-2022\">https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/dreaming-walls-inside-the-chelsea-hotel-movie-review-2022</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-08T09:10:25.000Z"},{"id":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fair-play-movie-review-2022","url":"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fair-play-movie-review-2022","title":"Fair Play","content_html":"<blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com\">All Content</a> <strong>Fair Play</strong></p> <p>by Nell Minow </p> <p><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.rogerebert.com/uploads/review/primary_image/reviews/fair-play-movie-review-2022/thumb_fair-play-movie-review-2022.jpg\" /></p><p>Writer Robin Beth Schaer’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/robinschaer/status/1109096787682492417?s=20&t=UtLId4nkWxXIOQHZygZR0w\" target=\"_blank\">tweet about a soap dispenser</a> went viral in 2019: “My friend & her husband lived in an apartment that had a soap dispenser installed on the edge of the kitchen sink. When they moved out after two years, he marveled to her: ‘It's amazing how that dispenser never ran out of soap in all this time.’ Women's work is truly invisible. She never told him the truth. He still thinks wistfully of that amazing, magical soap dispenser they had once.” <br></p> <p>The tweet inspired many responses from women about what has been called “the second shift,” “emotional labor,” or “the mental load.” It is the feeling of frustration many women feel when they constantly carry the anxiety-ridden checklist mindset about children and housekeeping. “Fair Play” is a documentary based on the best-selling book written by <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/eve-rodsky\">Eve Rodsky</a>, a Harvard-educated lawyer, about the disparity in domestic responsibilities. She describes herself as “working to change society one partnership at a time by coming up with a new 21st-century solution to an age-old problem: women shouldering 2/3 or more of the unpaid domestic work and childcare for their homes and families.” </p> <p>Every couple Rodsky asks at the beginning of the film about the division of labor disagrees about how much the husbands do. One couple both insisted they did 70 percent of the child care. The wives are all good-humored but occasionally there’s an edge to their comments. “Eating the food doesn’t count,” one notes. </p> <p>Here’s a hint: if someone describes what he does as “help,” it shows that he thinks it's a generous voluntary impulse, not an essential continuing responsibility. Those who believe their contribution is picking up milk at the store when asked need to realize that the more exhausting part of the job is constantly being aware of when milk is needed, not to mention bread, cereal, cheese, fruit, peanut butter, signed permission slips, dry cleaning, allergy shots, and piano lessons. One husband defends himself by describing his office’s “traditional” culture, which meant that when his wife had a baby on a Friday night, he was back in the office Monday morning. He later notes that a part of that office culture is that most of the men are divorced.</p> <p>The problem became clear to Rodsky when she and nine other women were supposed to have lunch together after a breast cancer march. All were in dual-career relationships and their husbands were home with the children. In 30 minutes, the women received 30 calls and 46 texts, asking questions like “Where is the gift for the birthday party?” and “Do the kids need to eat lunch?” The women all left for home so they could take care of things, some apologizing for giving their husbands more than they could handle.</p> <p>Rodsky applies her systems analysis skills to document the differences with a massive spreadsheet. The film has some statistics to back up her assessments, along with commentary from various experts, including <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/melinda-gates\">Melinda Gates</a>. We also meet some people struggling to create more balance, including Rodsky, her husband, and two couples she is advising. California Congresswoman <a href=\"/cast-and-crew/katie-porter\">Katie Porter</a> speaks about her experiences as a single mother to underscore the systemic “family-hostility” of US laws on parental leave, child care, and minimum wage. She pointedly calls out her colleagues, the older white male lawmakers, for assuming their own experiences are the norm. Same-sex couples, with less burden of gender expectations, genially provide a road map for negotiating domestic responsibilities. </p> <p>There is some diversity of race but not much of class or economic level in the film. The only family that is not financially comfortable are immigrant farmworkers. When that husband cuts back on his hours to spend more time with the family, there is no indication of the impact on the family of the reduction in income. There is little discussion of how families who can afford help remove some of the endless pressure of housework, other than comments from Ai-jen Poo, president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, on how these workers are chronically underpaid.</p> <p>It is not clear who this movie wants to speak to. Women do not need to be persuaded that too often there is a discrepancy in the emotional burden of caring for home and children. If it is men who need to be persuaded, the discussion of the improvement in men’s physical and mental health (and more sex!) when they form a truer partnership at home should probably have been at the beginning. If the intention is a “<a href=\"/reviews/an-inconvenient-truth-2006\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>”-style contribution to public policy discussions, the optimism about finding a more equal ownership of issues, like when we need milk, through couples communicating better ten minutes a day is unlikely to make that case. For one, it overlooks the common response that the partner who cedes some of the authority often finds it surprisingly hard to stop giving orders. </p> <p>The film’s good intentions are evident, but its assemblage of experts and statistics is more lecture than movie. There is too much focus on families of comfortable or better means and too little focus on the impact that these conflicts have on the other members of the family. Children need good examples of respectful partnership, cooperation, and compromise. We all say we want our children to be happy. The best way to do that is to give them an example of parents who know how to be happy.</p> <p><em>Now playing on AppleTV+.</em></p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fair-play-movie-review-2022\">https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/fair-play-movie-review-2022</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-08T09:10:09.000Z"},{"id":"https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/","url":"https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/","title":"チーターにより、eスポーツカフェの全PCが「ハードウェアBAN」の憂き目に","content_html":"<blockquote> <p><a href=\"https://srad.jp/\">スラド</a> <strong>チーターにより、eスポーツカフェの全PCが「ハードウェアBAN」の憂き目に</strong></p> <p>by nagazou <i>#games</i></p> <img align=\"right\" height=\"64\" width=\"64\" src=\"https://srad.jp/static/topics/games_64.png\"><a href=\"https://it.srad.jp/story/22/06/21/1549258/\">先日ビデオカード盗難の被害に遭った</a>ことで話題となった新大久保の「e-sports cafe」だが、新たな悲劇に見舞われたようだ。同店は時間あたりの料金体制でゲーミングPCで手軽にゲームが楽しめるサービスを提供していた（<a href=\"https://twitter.com/esportscafejp/status/1543939353537564672\">e-sports cafe 公式Twitter</a>、<a href=\"https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2207/06/news100.html\">ITmedia</a>、<a href=\"https://www.gamebusiness.jp/article/2022/07/05/20334.html\">GameBusiness.jp</a>、<a href=\"https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/ja/articles/360045619633\">VALORANTのエラーコード</a>、<a href=\"https://www.gamebusiness.jp/article/2022/07/05/20334.html\">slashdot</a>）。<br> <br> ITmediaの記事によると、7月4日に同店に設置している全77台のPC全てがFPS「<a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/ja-jp/\">VALORANT</a>」をプレイできなくなったという。表示されたエラーコードから、原因はゲーム上でチートツールなどの不正行為を行ったユーザーがおり、不正行為を行ったユーザーのPCからアカウント登録などを認めない「ハードウェアBAN」の対象になったためと見られている。同店では現在復旧にむけて対応中だとしている。<br> <br> あるAnonymous Coward 曰く、<blockquote><div><p>eスポーツカフェの使用には本人確認書類が必要で、またこの店舗では先日グラボ盗難事件があったということで監視カメラも設置されていたというが、やるやつはやるようだ。</p></div></blockquote><p> <a href=\"https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/\">すべて読む</a> | <a href=\"https://srad.jp/stories/business\">ビジネス</a> | <a href=\"https://srad.jp/stories/games\">ゲーム</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/share?url=https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/&text=%E3%83%81%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%81%AB%E3%82%88%E3%82%8A%E3%80%81e%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%84%E3%82%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7%E3%81%AE%E5%85%A8PC%E3%81%8C%E3%80%8C%E3%83%8F%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A2BAN%E3%80%8D%E3%81%AE%E6%86%82%E3%81%8D%E7%9B%AE%E3%81%AB\" title=\"この記事をTwitterでつぶやく\"><img alt=\"この記事をTwitterでつぶやく\" border=\"0\" src=\"//images.srad.jp/classic/img/twitter_32.png/20150127\" /></a> <a href=\"//www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/\" title=\"この記事をFacebookで共有\"><img src=\"//images.srad.jp/classic/img/facebook_32.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"この記事をFacebookで共有\" /></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/\" title=\"この記事をGoogle Plusで共有\"><img src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-32.png\" border=\"0\" alt=\"この記事をGoogle Plusで共有\" /></a> <a href=\"//b.hatena.ne.jp/entry/https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/\" title=\"このエントリーをはてなブックマークに追加\"><img src=\"https://b.st-hatena.com/images/entry-button/button-only@2x.png\" alt=\"このエントリーをはてなブックマークに追加\" width=\"32\" height=\"32\" style=\"border: none;\" border=\"0\" /></a> </p> <p> 関連ストーリー： <br><a href=\"https://it.srad.jp/story/22/06/21/1549258\">カフェでPC本体からビデオカードを抜き取る手口動画。GPU価格自体は低下傾向</a> <small>2022年06月22日</small> </p> <p>Article URL: <a href=\"https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/\">https://srad.jp/story/22/07/07/1534211/</a></p> </blockquote>","date_published":"2022-07-08T09:08:00.000Z"}]}
